Here is the descripion of a project of a portfolio: Sarah's alarm clock wakes her gently, and she quickly dresses, taking a moment to check the weather before heading out. A simple breakfast and a cup of coffee or tea provide a quick energy boost. With her helmet on and backpack secured, Sarah heads out the door for her daily journey through the city's construction sites and bustling streets, ready to tackle the day with determination. Sarah, an architecture student, confidently bikes through the bustling city, where stressed drivers navigate the streets alongside her. She skillfully weaves through the ongoing construction site of the new railway station and carefully maneuvers around impatient drivers negotiating a tricky roundabout. Amid the chaos, she finds moments to admire the city's evolving landscape and diverse neighborhoods, all while skillfully avoiding oil stains left by early morning commuters. During her ride, she encounters younger students on their way to elementary school, and she gracefully navigates around them, ensuring everyone's safety. As she pedals onward, the city's transformation serves as a constant backdrop to her journey. Finally, Sarah arrives at the university, a sense of accomplishment. To enhance road safety for cyclists and pedestrians, our solution introduces ambient information display on the ground to alert users to potential hazards. This innovation leverages camera technology for real-time road and surroundings analysis, projecting relevant safety information onto the ground to facilitate obstacle avoidance. This technology also alert cyclists of potential risks posed by pedestrians crossing the bicycle path. The system detects oil stains and promptly alerts cyclists by displaying them in red on the road surface. This solution not only addresses immediate safety concerns but also contributes to overall journey safety and urban mobility. Attributes of the user experience include heightened awareness, proactive hazard identification, and improved road-sharing dynamics between cyclists and pedestrians. The other project adresses the scarcity of bike parking spaces near the classroom, a common issue on crowded campuses. Our solution involves the implementation of a circular column system, where students could securely store their bicycles. This system allowed bikes to be parked at the bottom of the column and then automatically transported to different levels within the column. The advantages of this approach were threefold: firstly, it effectively saves precious space by utilizing vertical storage. Secondly, security could be enhanced through a card system that ensured only authorized users could access their bikes. Lastly, the systemâ€™s proximity to the facility made it exceptionally convenient for students, promoting sustainable transportation options while addressing the problem of limited bike parking spaces near the classroom."
