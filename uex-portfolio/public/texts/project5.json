The building is a modern, curved glass structure with a flat roof. There are several people walking around the building. The Rolex Learning Center is a library and learning center for EPFL for thousands of students. The building has a unique shape that creates different slopes and spaces inside. The students study, eat and work here during their study hours. A cluster of strategically positioned microwaves adjacent to the Rolex Learning Center redefines the mundane task of reheating meals, elevating it to a dynamic and engaging outdoor social experience. Beyond the mere convenience of quickly warming food, this innovative arrangement actively encourages students to step outside, immerse themselves in fresh air, and relish their lunch breaks in a vibrant communal setting. The deliberate placement of microwaves not only caters to functional needs but also promotes a healthier and more interactive lifestyle. The surplus of microwaves effectively minimizes wait times, ensuring that students can savor their lunch breaks without unnecessary delays. This thoughtful design not only enhances efficiency but transforms a routine activity into a delightful and fulfilling experience for the entire student community."
