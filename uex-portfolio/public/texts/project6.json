Here is the descripion of a project of a portfolio: As an architect, it can sometimes be challenging to relate to all the different user groups and fully understand their needs. This can occasionally result in poor designs or spaces that are not used or appreciated as expected. By using this tool and harnessing the knowledge and data from behavioral studies that provide insights into how different people behave, interact, and move around in the built environment, we can shape more inclusive, efficient, and socially sustainable buildings. This approach optimizes the utilization of space, reduces energy consumption, and enhances productivity. The risk is that the personas created in the tool can become one-sided and may not account for cultural variations, which can be significant in how people perceive and interact with their environment. Natural Selection is used as an iterative process of improvement of a design. At each iteration, the design made by the architect is given to the simulator, which will run experiments. The goal of these experiments is to simulate the behavior of predefined personas inside the building, to automatically detect flaws in the design. All personas that were not satisfied or blocked in their journey will not ‘survive’ the experiment, but instead of having a new generation of personas for next iteration, it is the building that will be improved by the architect. At the end of these simulations, a detailed report is generated with the journey of each persona and their failure point in order to help the architect embetter its design."
