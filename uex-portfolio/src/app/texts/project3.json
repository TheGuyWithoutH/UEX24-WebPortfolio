Here is the descripion of a project of a portfolio: This is Sarah, she is 30 years old and is an active outdoor enthusiast who loves winter sports, particularly skiing. She has a passion for adventure and exploring mountain slopes. She doesn’t let her physical disability hold her back and is determined to enjoy the thrill of skiing just like anyone else. Sarah has an eye for aesthetics and values well-designed products. She believes that outdoor gear, including her para-ski, should not only perform well but also look stylish and visually pleasing. Sarah doesn’t enjoy the high-tech look of para- skis because they make her feel different from other skiers, in a bad way. She would like her gear to look more human-like and not just be focused on the performance aspect. She is, after all, not a professional athlete, but rather a recreational skier that enjoys comfort and wants to enjoy the moment while not looking like a cyborg. The primary goal of this design is to seamlessly integrate functionality, aesthetics, and comfort for individuals with physical disabilities. By transforming a sports equipment for competitive skiing into a stylish and casual accessory that also serves as a prosthesis or leg support system, the design aims to eliminate the negative associations often attached to wearing adaptive suits. It strives to empower wearers with physical disabilities to feel confident, fashionable, and included while ensuring their ability to ski comfortably and without feeling different. This design caters to modern individuals with physical disabilities, particularly those who prioritize fashion and want to enjoy skiing in more relaxed settings. These users are aware of societal perceptions and seek a balance between style and functionality in their adaptive skiwear."
