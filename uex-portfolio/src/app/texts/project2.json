Here is the descripion of a project of a portfolio: Tijuana, Mexico, situated along the North-Western coast and bordering the United States directly, is a densely urbanized city with a hot climate. Stray dogs in Tijuana face multiple challenges, including issues of aggression, heat-related difficulties, and vulnerability to flooding. The prevalence of a traditional dog fighting sport exacerbates the problem, as defeated dogs are often abandoned on the streets, leading to aggressive behavior and injuries. The scorching climate contributes to concerns of overheating and dehydration among the canine population. Additionally, occasional storms and floods pose a significant threat, resulting in injuries and distress for many dogs in the area. From these observations came three ideas of projects: WATER MITIGATION - This design aims to create a specialized sprinkler system for overheated stray dogs in Tijuana. Strategically positioned nozzles, wrapping around a tree, providing shade release a cooling mist, providing relief from the heat. Simultaneously, the system includes a reservoir for clean water to rinse wounds, promoting a hygienic and healing environment for the dogs. This innovative solution combines functionality to address heat stress and wound care, enhancing the overall well-being of Tijuana’s stray canine population. FLOOD SHELTERING - This design concept for Tijuana envisions a practical and elevated solution to address the dangers of flooding for the city’s stray dog population. The creation of raised platforms strategically integrated onto existing urban infrastructure is proposed. Positioned at a specific height and interconnected, these platforms serve as secure shelter spaces for dogs during flooding events. THE TRAINING WALL - This design concept tackles the challenge of aggression in stray dogs through a specialized obstacle course. This course is designed to train and mentally stimulate aggressive strays, redirecting their energy in a positive way. With carefully crafted elements, including hurdles and interactive stations, the course promotes problem-solving and agility. Positive reinforcement techniques enhance the effectiveness of the training, aiming to transform aggressive behaviors and foster a healthier relationship between these dogs and their human communities."
